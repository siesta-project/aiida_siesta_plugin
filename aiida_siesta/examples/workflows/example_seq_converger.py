'''
This is an example of how to converge multiple parameters sequentially using the aiida_siesta
plugin.

It can be used for any parameter that the SiestaIterator understands. That is: fdf flags (including
the ones related to the basis), input keys of the SiestaBaseWorkChain or additional key parameters that
process the inputs for you to perform more complex input modifications. E.g: "kpoints_0", "kpoints_density"...

First of all, we need to setup all the inputs of the calculations.

See https://aiida-siesta-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/workflows/base.html#inputs.

Basically, we will build an "inputs" dict at the end of the file, and all we are doing until
there is to build every part of it step by step.

All this is general to any SIESTA calculation with AiiDa, so if you already know how it works,
go to the end of the file, where we really do the convergence specific stuff.
