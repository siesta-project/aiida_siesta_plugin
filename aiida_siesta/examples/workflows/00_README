In this folder we collect few scripts to show how to run workchains.
Users should take these scripts as templates and adapt them to their own case.
All the other script can be run through:
	runaiida script.py code@computer {stmcode@computer}
However, similarly to the case of plugin examples, the user should make sure that the 
computational resources selected in the script are compatible with their "computer"
(for instance "queue" and "account").

The "example_protocol" and "example_protocols_stm" showcase 
the use of the protocol system, a system to automatically 
suggest inputs for the WorkChain. The protocol approach still leaves compleate freedom
to change the inputs before submission.
In order to use these examples, a pseudo family named 'nc-sr-04_pbe_standard_psml' must be
loaded in the database and it should contain the 'nc-sr-04_pbe_standard_psml' pseudo set 
available from the PseudoDojo web site (http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/).
