'''
This is an example of how to launch multiple SIESTA simulations iterating
over one or more parameters using the aiida_siesta plugin.

'''
First of all, we need to setup all the inputs of the calculations.

See https://aiida-siesta-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/workflows/base.html#inputs.

Basically, we will build an "inputs" dict at the end of the file, and all we are doing until
there is to build every part of it step by step.

All this is general to any SIESTA calculation with AiiDa, so if you already know how it works,
go to the end of the file, where we really do the iterate specific stuff.
