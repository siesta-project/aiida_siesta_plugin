Workflows
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section we document the AiiDA WorkChains distributed in ``aiida-siesta``.
They are tools that automatize some simple tasks that are commonly faced during the
the research process.
The WorkChains are constructed using exclusively the
calculations plugin described in the section "Calculations".
