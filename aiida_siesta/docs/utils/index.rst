Utils
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section collects the documentation on tools that have been implemented in
the package, but can not be classified as traditional AiiDA objects.
The scope of these tools is a further improvement of the automatization
of siesta calculations. Some of them are more for development purposes (FDFDict),
others are for the benefit of any user (the protocol system).
