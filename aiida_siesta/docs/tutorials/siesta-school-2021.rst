These are the notes of the tutorial delivered to the CECAM school "First-principles simulations of materials with SIESTA"
running virtually from 28th of June to 2nd of July 2021.
The tutorial was carried on using the Siesta Mobile Virtual Machine, however reference to the relevant aiida documentation
is reported at the beginning. If you are running on Siesta Mobile, jump :ref:`here <start>`.

Tutor: Emanuele Bosoni

Installation and setup (ONLY IF NOT IN SIESTA MOBILE)
-----------------------------------------------------

Installation is through ``pip`` after moving to a new virual environment (we use ``virtualenvwrapper``, but any alternative is valid, only
make sure to select a python version 3.6 or above). We call the virtual environment ``tutorial``.

.. code-block:: python

   mkvirtualenv tutorial
   workon tutorial
   pip install aiida==1.6.1
   pip install aiida-siesta==1.2.0

Follow the instructions in the
`AiiDA documentation <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.1/intro/get_started.html>`_.
to set up aiida.

Computer and code setup (ONLY IF NOT IN SIESTA MOBILE)
------------------------------------------------------

Follow the `instructions <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/v1.6.1/howto/run_codes.html>`_
to set up your computer and a siesta executable.

.. _start:

Creating a pseudo family
------------------------

In the Siesta Mobile, activate the virtual environment ``workon siesta_school``.
Otherwise activate the environment you created before.

Check the status of aiida typing ``verdi status``. Check the codes installed with
``verdi code list``.

Before starting to play with `aiida-siesta`, it can be useful to learn how to
set up a pseudopotential family containing a collection of pseudos from `PseudoDojo <http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/>`_.
Just do::

     aiida-pseudo install pseudo-dojo -v 0.4 -x PBE -r SR -p standard -f psml

This will install version 0.4 PBE scalar relativistic and standard accuracy in psml form under the name
"PseudoDojo/0.4/PBE/SR/standard/psml".

If you have a FOLDER containing psf pseudopotentials, you can create a family with::

     aiida-pseudo install family /PATH/TO/FOLDER/ FAM_NAME -P pseudo.psf


Submit a single siesta calculation
----------------------------------

Open the file :download:`example_bands.py <data_siesta_school_2021/example_bands.py>` and explore the setting up of the various inputs.
Focus in particular in the understanding of the structure definition and also notice how easy is in AiiDA to request
the generation of an automatic k-point path for the bands. We use the pseudos family we created before.
Run the script with (if not in Siesta Mobile, change the code name inside the script)::

        runaiida example_bands.py --dont-send

The option ``--dont-send`` has been added in order to activate the "dry_run" option that every aiida process has.
This option allows to create all the inputs of the calculation, but do not submit it.
You can explore in the folder ``submit_test`` how AiiDA prepared all the inputs of a siesta calculation for you.

Now run::

        runaiida example_bands.py --send

AiiDA took charge of your script, created the inputs and submitted the calculation. Look at the state of the
process with the command ``verdi process show <pk>`` as suggested in the shell. The ``<pk>`` number
uniquely identify your calculation and it will be used later on.

In few seconds the calculation is finished. You will relized that when ``verdi process show <pk>`` 
shows "Finished" status and reports the oututs. We explore the outputs. This can be done from command line,
for instance::

        verdi data array show <PK_forces_and_stress>

        
however it is worth exploring the shell provided by AiiDA::

        verdi shell

Inside the shell::

        l=load_node(<PK_calculation>)

and explore all the methods making use of tab completion. For instance::

        l.outputs.bands.export(path="Si_bands", fileformat="gnuplot", y_max_lim=10)

The command above creates a file that can be plot with gnuplot in order to visualize the bands. Open a new shell and
type::

        gnuplot --persist Si_bands

Take the chance to explore in the ``verdi shell`` some methods and attributes of data types associated to 
the inputs and outputs of a ``SiestaCalculation``. Use tab complition of ``l.inputs``, ``l.outputs``, ``l.attributes``, ..

The submission script can be modified very easily in order to run a ``SiestaBaseWorkChain`` instead of a
``SiestaCalculation``. Look at the commented part of the ``example_bands.py`` script in order to understand the differences.
If you want to try to run a SiestaBaseWorkChain, just uncomment the 
``inputs["option"] =  Dict ...`` part and comment the line above (``inputs['metadata']['options'] = ..``
was just for the SiestaCalculation), change the definition of ``process`` and run the script.
The "dry_run" option is not available for the ``SiestaBaseWorkChain``.
A ``SiestaBaseWorkChain`` automatically takes care
of fixing some `common errors of a siesta calculation
<https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/aiida-siesta/en/v1.2.0/workflows/base.html#error-handling>`_,
therefore it adds robustness in running siesta calculations.

Protocols
---------
Go back to the ``verdi shell`` and look at the following::

        from aiida_siesta.workflows.base import SiestaBaseWorkChain
        inp_gen=SiestaBaseWorkChain.inputs_generator()

You just imported the inputs generator for the ``SiestaBaseWorkChain``. We can explore its functionality::

        inp_gen.get_protocol_names()
        inp_gen.get_spins()

And many more... Use tab complition to explore them. These methods allows you
to understand which options you can pass to ``get_filled_builder``, as will be explained in a second.

The main feature of the input generator is the possibility to obtain a ``builder`` (a tool that helps you build 
the inputs for the specific process) that is ready to be submitted::

        l=load_node(<PK_calculation>)  #The PK loaded before
        struct = l.inputs.structure
        calc_engines = {
            'siesta': {
                'code': "siesta-school--MaX-1.3.0-1@localhost",
                'options': {'resources': {'num_machines': 1, "num_mpiprocs_per_machine": 1},"max_wallclock_seconds": 3600}
                }
            }
        builder = inp_gen.get_filled_builder(struct,calc_engines,"standard_psml")

The ``calc_engines`` is a dictionary with fixed keys, whose aim is to pass the computational resourses
for the calculation.

Explore the ``builder``::

        builder.parameters.attributes
        builder.basis.attributes
        ...

We can add spin polarization to the calculation with::

        builder = inp_gen.get_filled_builder(struct,calc_engines,"standard_psml",spin="polarized")

Try again ``builder.parameters.attributes``, what are the differences compared to before?

We can run the builder straight away::

        from aiida.engine import run
        run(builder)

The calculation will take about 10 minutes, therefore let it run and go on with the tutorial.
At the end of this section you can come back on this terminal and explore the results if you wish.

We are now going to create our own protocol.
Look at the file :download:`my_protocols_registry.yaml <data_siesta_school_2021/my_protocols_registry.yaml>`. 
This is the way you specify a protocol in aiida-siesta, using YAML syntax.
You can recognize the same pseudos family used before and other familiar siesta keywords.
The ``spin_additions`` are added just for spin pilarized calculations. The ``relax_additions`` only for the 
times a relaxation is requested.
The ``atom_heuristics`` are added just if in the structure there is the indicated element.
Look at the `corresponding docs
<https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/aiida-siesta/en/v1.2.0/utils/protocols_system.html#how-to-create-my-protocols>`_,
for more info.

This file can be modified at will and its content will become a new protocol. Simply look at the folder where
you are ``pwd`` and attach the file to the correct environment variable, like that:: 

        export AIIDA_SIESTA_PROTOCOLS="path_discovered_with_pwd/my_protocols_registry.yaml"

taking care of passing the correct absolute path where you have ``my_protocols_registry.yaml``.

Now open the shell and::

        from aiida_siesta.workflows.base import SiestaBaseWorkChain
        inp_gen=SiestaBaseWorkChain.inputs_generator()
        inp_gen.get_protocol_names()

The new protocol is on the list and we can use it to run a calculation::

        l=load_node(<PK_calculation>)
        struct = l.inputs.structure
        calc_engines = {
            'siesta': {
                'code': "siesta-school--Max-1.3.0-1@localhost",
                'options': {'resources': {'num_machines': 1, "num_mpiprocs_per_machine": 1},"max_wallclock_seconds": 3600}
                }
            }
        builder = inp_gen.get_filled_builder(struct,calc_engines,"my_protocol")

        from aiida.engine import run
        run(builder)

The command ``run`` send the calcualation in the shell in interactive mode (does not submit to the builder
as ``submit`` would do).
Our set up will occupy the shell for a minute or so and at the end it will return the outputs of the calculation.


Run a convergence workflow
--------------------------

It's quite easy to run a convergence workflow using `aiida-siesta`.

For instance, in a verdi shell you can do (taking care again to integrate the correct PK)::

        from aiida_siesta.workflows.converge import SiestaSequentialConverger
        from aiida.engine import run

        calc_node=load_node(<PK_calculation>)

        run(SiestaSequentialConverger,

                iterate_over=[
                        {
                         "kpoints_0": [4,6,8,10,12,14,16],
                         "kpoints_1": [4,6,8,10,12,14,16],
                         "kpoints_2": [4,6,8,10,12,14,16],
                        },
                        {
                         'meshcutoff': ["500 Ry", "600 Ry", "700 Ry", "800 Ry", "900 Ry"],
                        }
                ],

                converger_inputs={
                        'code':load_code('siesta-school--MaX-1.3.0-1@localhost'),
                        'pseudo_family': Str('PseudoDojo/0.4/PBE/SR/standard/psml'),
                        'structure': calc_node.inputs.structure,
                        'parameters': Dict(),
                        'options': Dict(dict={'resources': {'num_machines': 1, "num_mpiprocs_per_machine": 1},"max_wallclock_seconds": 3600}),
                        'batch_size': Int(3)
                }

        )

This code will converge your structure's kpoints (increasing all the components at the same time) and subsequently
the meshcutoff using the converged kpoints.
Three simulations at a time will be performed as specified by the ``batch_size`` input.
