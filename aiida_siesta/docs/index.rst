The Siesta input plugin was originally developed by Victor M. Garcia-Suarez.

Alberto Garcia further improved the Siesta input plugin and wrote the parser for Siesta and the STM plugin.

Emanuele Bosoni contributed the band-structure support for the Siesta plugin.

Vladimir Dikan and Alberto Garcia developed the workflows and
refined the architecture of the package.

Vladimir Dikan and Emanuele Bosoni ported the plugin and the base workflow to AiiDA 1.0.
