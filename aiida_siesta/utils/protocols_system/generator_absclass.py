    """
    This abstract class sets the structure for WorkChain specific inputs generators,
    meaning classes that are able to produce WorkChain inputs starting from
    a structure, a protocol and few more task specific options.

    Child classes need to define _calc_types (containing the schema for the
    computational resources to use) and the methods `get_inputs_dict` and `get_filled_builder`.
    The `get_inputs_dict` will implement all the logic to construct the inputs
    and return them in a dictionary. The `get_filled_builder` has the duty to create an already filled
    builder of the WorkChain. This last method, in theory, could be a general
    method that the child classes don't need to override. In fact it just call `get_inputs_dict`
    and places the dictionary entry in the empty builder.
    However the signature of `get_inputs_dict` can change case by case and the one of
    `get_filled_builder` must be change as well accordingly. If there was a possibility
    to impose automatically to `get_filled_builder` the same signature of `get_inputs_dict`,
    there woudn't be the need to define `get_filled_builder` as abstactmethod.

    Moreover, the workchain_class (the WorkChain the subclass will produce inputs for)
    is passed as a first argument during the instanciation of the class..
    This is not strictly necessary (the workchain_class could be requested as an attribute
    of child classes - exactly like _calc_types), however this strategy was adopted in order
    to avoid cyclic dependence and it can be advantageous if more then one workchain_class
    works with the exact same input generator.
